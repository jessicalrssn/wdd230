        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <p>Chick-fil-a</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com/ " target="_blank">Chick-fil-a.com</a>
        </p>
          <img src="/images/white-space.png" alt="Screenshot of the Chick-fil-a mobile website"/>
          <p>The Chick-fil-a website is a great example of an effective use of white space.
            The breathing room around each element makes this site nice to look at and easy to understand.
            There is no question what you are supposed to do while visiting. 
            It is not cluttered with unnessesary things to make the site messy and unorganized.
            It is clean, simple and beautifully designed.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>National Geographic</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/" target="_blank">nationalgeographic.com</a>
        </p>
          <img src="images/contrast.png" alt="Screenshot of the bucketlist family mobile website"/>
          <p>The National Geographic website uses contrast very well. 
            Using a black background really makes all the other elements pop.
            The white text is a good contrast to the black background and makes it super easy to read, and the images
            set against a black backdrop stand out a lot more. 
            The contrast of this site draws in the viewer and directs them through the site very well.

        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p>The Grand America Hotel</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.grandamerica.com/" target="_blank">grandamerica.com</a>
        </p>
          <img src="images/repetition.png" alt="Screenshot of the Chick-fil-a mobile website"/>
          <p>You can't see it from this screenshot but this website uses the principle of repetition very well. 
            As you scroll down you will see that the pictures, headlines, and paragraphs all use the exact same format throughout.
           You won't be suprized with a jumble of different designs.
            This use of repetition creates a clean and balanced website which is very successful.
