    </ul>
    <p> Brad owns an ATV rental business in Bear Lake Utah. His main goal is to expand this business. 
        He knows that with a better trail system in place, business would grow and he could rent more ATV's.
        Brad would like help lobbying for improved trail systems and thinks the Chamber 
        of commerce can help him figure out how to do this so he looked up their website to find recources.

    <p>Why would he visit this site?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To find recources to help his business grow</li>
        <li>To find an advocate to help him with the trail systems</li>
        <li>To look up the next member meeting date</li>
        <li>To view current ATV trails</li>
        <li>To connect with other business owners who have similar interests</li>

    </ul>
    <p> Christina has been visiting Bear Lake with her family every summer for over 20 years. 
        She recently noticed a lack of variety in the area's current food offerings and thinks she could 
        bring something new to the table. She previously owned a restaurant but took a break to raise her family.
        Her goal is to get back in the game and open a new unique restaurant in Garden City and would like
         support from the local Chamber of Commerce. 
    
    </p>
    <p>Why would she visit this site?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To view a list of restaurants in town</li>
        <li>To see how many visitors Bear Lake got last year</li>
        <li>To network with members of the commerce</li>
        <li>To find training opportunities</li>
        <li>To view rules and regulations for starting a business in Bear Lake</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"I am excited to start this new venture in this incredible town. I'm looking forward to being part
        of this community."</p>
